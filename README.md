## Overview

The Social Media Backend REST-API that empowers users to post, comment, like, send friend requests, and reset their passwords using OTP for enhanced security. The project follows an REST API architecture using Express.js for server-side routing and MongDB for efficient data handling.

## Key Technologies

- Node.js - JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.
- Express.js - Flexible web framework for building APIs and web applications.
- MongoDB - NoSQL database known for its scalability and flexibility.
